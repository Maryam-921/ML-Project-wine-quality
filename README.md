üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction Project
This project dives into the Wine Quality dataset to explore, visualize, and predict the quality of wine using a variety of machine learning models. Built in a Jupyter Notebook, the workflow demonstrates a full data science pipeline‚Äîfrom raw data to insightful predictions.

üîç Key Highlights:

    * Exploratory Data Analysis: Performed comprehensive statistical summaries, value counts, grouping by quality, and duplicate checks to understand the dataset‚Äôs structure.
    * Visualization: Used heatmaps, pie charts, joint plots, and hex bins to reveal relationships between chemical properties and wine quality.
    * Preprocessing: Handled outliers, standardized features, and split data into training and testing sets to prepare for modeling.
    * Modeling & Evaluation:
        -- Implemented and compared multiple classification models: SVM, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Logistic Regression.
        -- Evaluated performance using confusion matrices and accuracy metrics.
        -- Highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of each model with a final summary.
        -- This project highlights my ability to analyze structured data, apply various classification models, and interpret model performance in a meaningful way.
